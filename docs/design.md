# Overview
There will be three main views, selectable on the left hand side of the screen.
# Animals
This page will have different tabs, selectable at the top of the screen. There will be one tab for each farm. Each tab will look the same, but just with different animals. The tab view will consist of two main parts: a toolbar and a table of animals/groups.

## Toolbar
The toolbar will contain buttons for simple operations such as add/delete animal, along with sorting/filter options.

### Sorting Options
These are just examples:
- Date of birth
- Expected date of giving birth
- Weight

### Filter Options
These are just examples:
- Vaccine status
- Sex
- Pregnant
- Owner
- Enclosure
- Species (filtering by animal type will cause additional species-specific columns to appear)

## Table
The main part of the animals tab is a table of animals. Each row can be either an individual animal, or a group of animals. If it is a group, it will have an expand button that will show animals in the group. There will be columns that will show the properties of the animals. Some of these will show up all the time (DOB, Owner, Enclosure), while some will only show up for specific species (TB Inoculation, etc).

# Calendar
The calendar will be a standard calendar view that can show events on each day, with reminders.

# Agenda
The agenda will show upcoming tasks/events in chronological order. They will have checkboxes that can be marked off when the task is done. This will show all the events from the calendar, but also tasks without a specific date. For example: tasks that must be completed during a specific week, but can be completed at any time during the week.
