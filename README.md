# 2023-City Farm

## Project Description
The aim is to create a virtual system which can be accessed remotely by different farmers and can provide an accessible interface to log livestock data such as movements, age, heritage, enclosure etc so that farmers can coordinate dates and their livestock more easily to avoid clashes.

## Stakeholders
The stakeholders of this project are the livestock manager and livestock assistants at the following farms:
* Windmill Hill City Farm
* Hartcliffe City Farm
* St Werburghs City Farm

## User Stories
As the livestock manager of three city farms, I would like a system that automates the input of specific dates and relevant animal data into a calendar, so that I can spend time managing other areas of my work.
