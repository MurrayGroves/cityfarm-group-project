# Completed Work #

The project in its current state allows for CRUD operations on Animals, Enclosures, and Calendar Events.

Animal types can be created by the user supporting custom properties of thefollowing types:
- Boolean (Yes / No)
- String
- Integer
- Decimal
- Calendar Event

This is a flexible system that relies on the user creating sensible attributes for animals.

# Future Plans #

- Automatic scheduling of events when modifying attributes
    - e.g. a sheep gets their 'Pregnant' attribute changed to 'Yes'
    - so an event should be made in 150 days called 'Lambing' with that animal attached
