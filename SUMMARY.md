The project in its current state allows for CRUD operations on Animals, Enclosures, and Calendar Events.
Animal types can be created by the user supporting custom properties of thefollowing types:
- Boolean (Yes / No)
- String
- Integer
- Decimal
- Calendar Event

This is a flexible system that relies on the user creating sensible attributes for animals.
